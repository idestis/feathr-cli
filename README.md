Feathr-cli is a complimentary tool. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient invoice generation experience.

## Story

Working with multiple clients in parallel, I was exhausted creating the invoices for each of them monthly, weekly, or by providing one-time service. I have tried no one or two tools, which suppose to ease this process, and I fall in love with one - [slimvoice.co](https://slimvoice.co).

Same as `feathr-cli`, Slimvoice it is just a side project, but EOL date of this service is 1 April 2023. I did another try to find a tool which can replace slimvoice with a same easy of use, unfortunately was not able to find it. Some of them have a bunch of features which is not needed by the essence of my work, and some of them are slow or complex. So I have decided to create workflows in CLI way, which continues my work, so I easy can integrate send of invoices into my workflow. Hope you can as well.

## Getting Started

TBD

## Code

The code is a side project created by a single individual to resolve a personal challenge of quickly sending invoices. The developer chose to embark on this project to solve their own issue, resulting in a codebase designed for a specific purpose. Despite being the work of a single individual, the codebase may still offer users an efficient and effective way to manage their invoicing.

## Security

Feathr-cli values its users' privacy and ensures that their data is secure and not shared with any third-party services.
The tool does not use the data for any analytical purposes, guaranteeing that users' information remains private and confidential.

## Future

Feathr-cli aims to expand its services to include a new feature in the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) space, providing users with the ability to send invoices as Verified Credentials. This feature is designed to improve trust and confidence in individual entrepreneurs by allowing them to leverage the benefits of SSI technology. By incorporating this new feature, Feathr.io hopes to provide a more secure and reliable invoicing experience for its users.
