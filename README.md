Feathr-cli is a complimentary tool. The goal is to provide a simple and efficient invoice generation experience.

## Code

The code is a side project created by a single individual to resolve a personal challenge of quickly sending invoices. The developer chose to embark on this project to solve their own issue, resulting in a codebase designed for a specific purpose. Despite being the work of a single individual, the codebase may still offer users an efficient and effective way to manage their invoicing.

## Security

Feathr-cli values its users' privacy and ensures that their data is secure and not shared with any third-party services.
The tool does not use the data for any analytical purposes, guaranteeing that users' information remains private and confidential.

## Future

Feathr-cli aims to expand its services to include a new feature in the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) space, providing users with the ability to send invoices as Verified Credentials. This feature is designed to improve trust and confidence in individual entrepreneurs by allowing them to leverage the benefits of SSI technology. By incorporating this new feature, Feathr.io hopes to provide a more secure and reliable invoicing experience for its users.
